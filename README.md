# Question-Time

## 
This homework has been a headache and a joy all at once. I tried to keep everything neat and clean. I ran into issues with event listeners, timers, and the form but in the end with some help I was able to get through it. I feel like I could go back and clean this up however I think I will keep it as is to kinda show where I started.

I want to thank Denis Molloy, Anthony Zachary, Joe Refuss, Brett Belka, and Dion Leung. Believe it or not but the late night zoom was a big help talking through the problems! Also thanks to Wallpaper Abyss for the background image!
